          <span style="color: #f26322">I</span>am delighted to introduce our new
          impact report and show you what Back Up has been doing to inspire
          people affected by spinal cord injury to get the most out of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m incredibly proud to tell you that we supported over 1,000 people
          affected by spinal cord injury last year. Every day, I hear stories of
          the lives that Back Up has touched – whether that’s someone rebuilding
          their confidence on one of our outdoor activity courses, pushing to
          the shops independently for the first time, or just saying at the end
          of a call that they no longer felt like they were in this alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this report, you will read the stories of seven people we helped
          last year. Their stories were made possible by our wonderful
          fundraisers, donors and corporate sponsors who bring in more money
          each year to support our vital work. Their tireless efforts saw Back
          Up raise £1,682,167 – the most income in our history.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every staff member here, we estimate that there are around 10
          volunteers supporting our work in a multitude of ways. They are the
          lifeblood of Back Up, delivering the services that make a huge
          difference to so many people’s lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          To each and every one of you who gives their time or money, I want to
          thank you for all that you do and encourage you to read on to see the
          difference your contribution makes. If you’ve never supported Back Up
          before, please join us as we work towards a world where everyone
          affected by spinal cord injury can realise their full potential.
        </p>
